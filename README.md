## Contributions

We are using the devcontainers VS Code extension for this app. Please have the [Remote Connections extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) installed in VS Code and install the [Docker Desktop app](https://www.docker.com/).

When you open VS Code you will be asked to reopen in container. It will take a few minutes to download and run the provided image the first time, but it contains the necessary tooling for our project and should come right up after the first time.
